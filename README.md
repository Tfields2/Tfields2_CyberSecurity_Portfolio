# [Project 1:  NIST CSF 2.0 Icident Response Plan - Cantaluope Inc](https://tfields2.github.io/Nist_CSF_2.0_Incident_Response_Cantaloupe-Inc./)

This was a group project I did in my final semester of undergrad at The University of Alabama. This project documents the design and formalization of a NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) 2.0-aligned Incident response Plan for Cantaloupe Inc. The objective was to create a structured, regulatory-aware framework addressing detection, containment, eradcation, recovery, and post-incident improvement.

- Developed a NIST CSF 2.0 aligned incident response plan for Canatloupe Inc.
- Defined the end to end response lifecycle, including detection, containment, recovery, and post-incident improvement
- Established incident governance, roles, and escalation procedures
- Created scenerio based response playbook for common financial sector incident (Ransomeware attack)
- Mapped controls to NIST CSF 2.0 Respond and Recover functions
- Presented the finalized documentation to a cybersecurity governance board for review
