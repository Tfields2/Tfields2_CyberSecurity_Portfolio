# [Project 1:  NIST CSF 2.0 Icident Response Plan - Cantaluope Inc]()

This is a group project I did in my final semester of undergrad at The University of Alabama. This project documents the design and formalization of a NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) 2.0-aligned Incident response Plan for Cantaloupe Inc. The objective was to create a structured, regulatory-aware framework addressing detection, containment, eradcation, recovery, and post-incident improvement.
