# [Project 1:  NIST CSF 2.0 Icident Response Plan - Cantaluope Inc](https://tfields2.github.io/Nist_CSF_2.0_Incident_Response_Cantaloupe-Inc./)

This was a group project I did in my final semester of undergrad at The University of Alabama. This project documents the design and formalization of a NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) 2.0-aligned Incident response Plan for Cantaloupe Inc. The objective was to create a structured, regulatory-aware framework addressing detection, containment, eradcation, recovery, and post-incident improvement.

- Developed a NIST CSF 2.0 aligned incident response plan for Canatloupe Inc.
- Defined the end to end response lifecycle, including detection, containment, recovery, and post-incident improvement
- Established incident governance, roles, and escalation procedures
- Created scenerio based response playbook for common financial sector incident (Ransomeware attack)
- Mapped controls to NIST CSF 2.0 Respond and Recover functions
- Presented the finalized documentation to a cybersecurity governance board for review

# [Project 2: Applied Cybersecurity](https://tfields2.github.io/Applied-Cybersecurity/)

These projects demonstrate hands-on experience across **security operations, incidents response, risk and vulnerability assessment, and governance, risk, and compliance (GRC)**. The work applies practical security techniques and industry frameworks to investigate suspicious activity, analyze and respond to security incidents, assess organizational risk, and evaluate control effectiveness. Emphasis is placed on evidence based analysis, least-privilege enforcement, structured incident response, and clear technical documentation aligned with real world cybersecurity practices.
## Project Arees & Skills Demonstrated
- **Technical Security Labs**
- SQL-based investigation of suspicious login activity and authentication logs
  - Linux file and directory permission management enforcing least privilege

- **Incident Response & Analysis**
  - Ransomware incident documentation including detection, containment, and recovery planning
  - DDoS attack analysis with root cause identification and post-incident improvements
  - Incident analysis aligned with the NIST Cybersecurity Framework

- **Risk & Vulnerability Management**
  - Qualitative vulnerability and risk assessment using NIST SP 800-30 Rev. 1
  - Threat source identification, likelihood and impact scoring, and risk prioritization

- **Governance, Risk, & Compliance (GRC)**
  - Evaluation of administrative, technical, and physical security controls
  - Compliance gap analysis aligned with PCI DSS, GDPR, and SOC principles
  - Risk-based security recommendations to improve organizational security posture
